# Inspiration Behind TrueConsensus 🌟
It all started with our shared frustration over opaque ranking sites and clunky group chat polls. We were fed up with hidden algorithms that left users guessing how votes were counted, breeding distrust and skepticism. That’s when **TrueConsensus** was born—a platform designed to shatter the mystery and revolutionize voting. By eliminating the need to create polls in group chats, we deliver a seamless, transparent experience where every vote counts right on the website.

## Why We Built TrueConsensus 🚀
Our mission is clear: **restore trust and clarity to the voting process**. We built TrueConsensus as an **open-source** platform featuring an algorithm that anyone can inspect, verify, and even modify. This isn’t just about voting but about empowering you with complete visibility and control over the process.

## Challenges and Accomplishments 🏆
One of our toughest challenges was ensuring that every authenticated user could vote only once, maintaining the integrity of our system. Crafting a transparent algorithm using the Condorcet voting method demanded innovative thinking and rigorous planning. The **Condorcet method** is a voting system that identifies the candidate who would win a one-on-one election against each of the other candidates. This method ensures that the most broadly preferred candidate wins, rather than just the one with the most votes. Despite these hurdles, we’re proud to have built a platform that invites community collaboration and empowers users to redefine how voting should work.

## Lessons Learned 
we learned how to stack cups like a pro.

## What’s Next for TrueConsensus 🔮
- Scaling the platform to serve a larger community
- Expanding the reach of our transparent, community-driven voting system
- Disrupting outdated voting methods with fresh, user-first innovations
